Iterator: a pointer-like object that can be incremented with ++, dereferenced with *, and compared against another iterator with !=.
Iterators are generated by STL container member functions, such as begin() and end(). Some containers return iterators that support only the above operations, while others return iterators that can move forward and backward, be compared with <, and so on.
